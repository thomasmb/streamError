The basic purpose of this script is to provoke the app to show the Network read 
error produced by the Titanium AudioPlayer class. This error shows up randomly 
and has in my other apps made the app useless as it becomes inresponsive, variables 
get lost and animation stops working.

The reason I made this is because the script will save you the trouble of having 
to press play until you get the error (although it could happen the very first time 
it tries to play, but like I said, it's appears randomly). Also the script will not 
stop once the error appears, becayse there is no way of knowing wheter it occured or 
not.
